		<li>1936-Publishes "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the <i>Entscheidungsproblem</i>." Introduces the concept of the Turing machine.</li>
		<li>1936-1938-Studies under Alonzo Church at Princeton.</li> 
		<li>1938-Obtains PhD from Princeton with the dissertation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_of_Logic_Based_on_Ordinals" target="_blank"><i>Systems of Logic Based on Ordinals</i></a>.</li>

		<li>1942-Helps crack the German Naval Enigma system.</li>
		<li>1952-Publishes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chemical_Basis_of_Morphogenesis" target="_blank">"The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis"</a>.</li>
		<li>1954-Died due to cyanide poisoning, possibly from an apple which was found half-eaten at his bedside. Turing was known to reguraly eat an apple before going to bed. Several other theories exist about the cause of his cyanide poisoning.</li>
